# Status and Roadmap

The joint corpus for ADL and other text sources can be delivered
through one head, with a common oesophagus but separate guts.


## Corpora and capabilities

Different encoding practices (or even entirely different data
encodings) yields documents with different capabilities.

### ADL

Done.

__Capabilities:__ Apart from facsimiles, the corpus itself has no interesting capabilities.

* http://beta-text.kb.dk/text/adl-texts-aare01val-root

Left: Need to reimplement the links from author portraits and period
descriptions to texts. Hard work in editing the text, even if we can
do it semi-automatically. Hence currently low priority.

### SKS

Done

__Capabilities:__ No facsimiles, but digitized page examples. The
corpus itself has embedded footnotes by Kierkegaard and an apparatus
criticus and editorial notes and comments and introductions in
separate TEI files called kom.xml and txr.xml. The text comes in a
file txt.xml.

### Grundtvig

Only example texts. Waiting and not ready to go.

* http://beta-text.kb.dk/text/grundtvig-1816_297-txt-root

### Holberg

Done for example texts. Waiting and not ready to go.

__Capabilities:__ Like SKS, but with different naming conventions. Also translated and modernized texts.

* http://beta-text.kb.dk/text/holberg-niels_klim-niels_klim-root

Left: Capabilities differs between objects. Niels Klim is written in
Latin, but there is a Danish translation. Jeppe has a version in modernized Danish
version and one in the original early 18th century style.

### ALTO and METS & ALTO text

High priority, no data.
