# Status and Roadmap

The joint corpus for ADL and other text sources can be delivered
through one head, with a common oesophagus but separate guts.

## Capabilities



## Corpora

Different encoding practices (or even entirely different data
encodings) yields documents with different capabilities.

### ADL

Largely done. Need to reimplement the links from author portraits and
period descriptions to texts. Hard work in editing the text. Currently
low priority.

__Capabilities:__ Apart from facsimiles, the corpus itself has no interesting capabilities.

### SKS

Done

__Capabilities:__ No facsimiles, but digitized page examples. The
corpus itself has embedded footnotes by Kierkegaard himself and
apparatus criticus and editorial notes and comments and introductions
in separate TEI files called kom.xml and txr.xml. The text comes in a
file txt.xml.

### Grundtvig

Only example texts. Waiting and not ready to go.

### Holberg

Only example texts. Waiting and not ready to go.

__Capabilities:__ Like SKS, but with different naming conventions. Also translated and modernized texts.

### ALTO and METS & ALTO text

High priority, no data.
