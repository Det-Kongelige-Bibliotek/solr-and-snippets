# Solrs and Snippets 

All the software are variations upon a single theme. The theme can be
described as follows:

Assume that we have (semi)structured (meta)data in a database or
repository of some kind.  Then the snippet server is used for
performing various operations upon those data.

Examples of such operations are

* returning documents prepared for indexing
* pieces of texts for reading
* image URIs for viewing pages
* pieces of metadata for a detailed presentation 


We refer to the store as being the _Snippet Server_, the data inside
it as _data_ and the results returned from the operations as
_Snippets_. The word snippet comes from the fact that it is usually
just a part of a document returned.

Currently 

* the data is often in XML format
* the snippet server functionalities are written in XSLT or Xquery or both
* the snippets in JSON, HTML or XML

The Snippet Server has to support CRUD basic functionalities. The
indexing is is currently SOLR and the snippet crud eXist
