# Status and Roadmap

The joint corpus for ADL and other text sources can be delivered
through one head, with a common oesophagus but separate guts.

## Capabilities



## Corpora

Different encoding practices (or even entirely different data
encodings) yields documents with different capabilities.

### ADL

Largely done. Need to reimplement the links from author portraits and
period descriptions to texts. Hard work in editing the text. Currently
low priority.

_Capabilities:_ The corpus itself has no interesting capabilities.
