# Solrs and Snippets 

All the software are variations upon a single theme. The theme can be
described as follows:

Assume that we have (semi)structured (meta)data in a database or
repository of some kind.  Then the snippet server is used for
performing various operations upon those data.

Examples of such operations are

* returning documents prepared for indexing
* pieces of texts for reading
* image URIs for viewing pages
* pieces of metadata for a detailed presentation 


We refer to the store as being the _Snippet Server_, the data inside
it as _data_ and the results returned from the operations as
_Snippets_. The word snippet comes from the fact that it is usually
just a part of a document returned.

Currently 

* the data is often in XML format
* the snippet server functionalities are written in XSLT or Xquery or both
* the snippets are returned in JSON, HTML or XML

The Snippet Server has to support CRUD basic functionalities. The
indexing is is currently SOLR and the snippet crud eXist

## The Snippet Server and its arguments

The scripts and transforms are in the directory exports. For ADL the following are
available

* open-seadragon-config.xq (web service providing JSON for OSD)
* present.xq (general purpose presentation script)

For letters we have in addition

* save.xq (updates the TEI header in the letter project. Data recieved in JSON). Returns a SOLR document in XML
* volume.xq (renders a table of content for a volume

Most Snippet Server scripts support the following arguments

* doc -- the name of the document to be rendered or transformed
* c   -- if there are more sub-collections inside the data set, c is the name of the dirctory where doc is to be retrieved. Default is 'texts' for ADL, other are 'periods' and 'authors'
* op  -- is the operation to be performed upon the document doc. Possible op are
  * 'render' which implies that doc is transformed into HTML. http://labs.kb.dk/storage/adl/present.xq?doc=aakjaer01val.xml&op=render
  * 'solrize' which returns a solr <add> ... </add> which is ready to be sent to SOLR. C.f., http://labs.kb.dk/storage/adl/present.xq?doc=aakjaer01val.xml&op=solrize
  * 'facsimile' which returns a HTML document with images of the pages. Since we introduced OSD, it is only used for PDF generation. http://labs.kb.dk/storage/adl/present.xq?doc=aakjaer01val.xml&op=facsimile
  * 'toc' returns a HTML table of contents http://labs.kb.dk/storage/adl/present.xq?doc=aakjaer01val.xml&op=toc 
* id  -- the id of a part inside the doc which is to be treated. 
* q -- assuming that 'q' is the query, the present.xq is labelling the hits in the text

Some more examples

* Holberg, vol 3, HTML: http://labs.kb.dk/storage/adl/present.xq?doc=holb03val.xml&op=render
* Den politiske Kandst√∏ber, Actus II http://labs.kb.dk/storage/adl/present.xq?doc=holb03val.xml&op=render&id=idm140583366846000
* A single 'speak' in that play, 
  * as HTML http://labs.kb.dk/storage/adl/present.xq?doc=holb03val.xml&op=render&id=idm140583366681648
  * or as SOLR doc http://labs.kb.dk/storage/adl/present.xq?doc=holb03val.xml&op=solrize&id=idm140583366681648
* A TOC for a small work http://labs.kb.dk/storage/adl/present.xq?doc=aakjaer01val.xml&op=toc&id=workid59384


## Ingest and Indexing utilities

These utilities require the presence a local file system with stuff to be loaded. The resources in the file system are assumed to be maintained using git.

### Retrieving data from origin

```
indexing/git_retriever.pl --gitdir=<git project> --file_list=files_to_be_indexed.text

where

--gitdir is a local directory connected to your origin (usually at github)
--file_list is text file where the names of the updated files are written, one per line

if a file list isn't given, then the file names are written to standard output

```

### Storing to exist


```
./indexing/exist_loader.pl <options>
where options are
   --load <directory> 
        from where to read files for loading
   --get <directory>
        where to write retrieved files
   --delete <directory with a backup>
        the files in that are found in the directory will be deleted from the
        database if there exist files with the same name

    --suffix <suffix> 
        file suffix to look for in directory. for example xml

    --target <target name>
        Basically database name. Default is 

    --context <context>
        Root for the rest services. Default is /exist/rest/db/

    --user <user name>
    --password <password of user>
    --host-port <host and port for server>
        Default is localhost:8080

For example

exist_loader.pl --file-list files_to_be_indexed.text \
		--user admin \
		--password secret \
		--host-port localhost:8080  \
		--context /exist/rest/db/adl/

will load the xml-files named in files_to_be_indexed.text into a database with base URI

http://localhost:8080/exist/rest/db/adl/

 
```

### Running solrizr and loading solr docs into cloud


```
indexing/solr_updater.pl \
    --file-list=files_to_be_indexed.text \
    --param exist_host=localhost \
    --param exist_port=8080 \
    --param service=adl \
    --param op=solrize \
    --param solr_host=localhost \
    --param solr_port=8983 \
    --param collection=adl

```


## Minor utilities

* xslt transform all files with `--suffix xml` in the `--directory ./periods/` with a style `--sheet` preprocess.xsl 
```
indexing/transform-all.pl --sheet exporters/common/preprocess.xsl --directory ./periods/ --suffix xml
```
